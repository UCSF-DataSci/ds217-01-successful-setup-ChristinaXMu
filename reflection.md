# Getting to Know You

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
My name is Christina Mu. I am a T32 postdoctoral researcher in the NIA "Training for Research on Aging and Chronic Disease" program in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. I obtained my PhD in Aging Studies from University of South Florida. My research interests are in sleep health and pain among middle-aged and older adults. I enjoy running, long walks, cooking, baking, and spending time with friends and family! 

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
I hope to gain a better understanding of coding for statistical analyses and data visualization. Additionally, I noticed that a lot of job opportunities that I am interested in are seeking skills in Python, R, and SQL. My career goals are to be in a research focused position studying aging and health.

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
I am excited to grasp the fundamentals and to eventually learn more advanced techniques within Python, such as data management and analyses for large and longitudinal datasets, especially EHR data and machine learning. I am concerned that I will not be able to memorize Python code in order to code independently and that I may struggle with some of the statistical applications of Python.

# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
My name is Christina Mu. I am a T32 postdoctoral researcher in the NIA "Training for Research on Aging and Chronic Disease" program, which is in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. I obtained my PhD in Aging Studies from University of South Florida. My research interests are in sleep health and pain among middle-aged and older adults. I enjoy running, long walks, cooking, and baking. 

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
I hope to gain a better understanding of coding for statistical analyses and data visualization. I took interest in this course because I noticed that a lot of job opportunities that I am interested in seeking some familiarity with Python, R, and SQL. My career goals are to be in a research focused position studying aging and health.

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
I am excited to grasp the fundamentals and to eventually learn more advanced techniques within Python, such as data management and analyses for large and longitudinal datasets. I am concerned that I will not be able to memorize Python code in order to code independently and that I may struggle with some of the statistical applications of Python.
